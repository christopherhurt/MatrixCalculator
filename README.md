# MatrixCalculator
A more recent version of my old matrix calculator, which can be found [here](https://github.com/christopherhurt/MatrixCalculatorOLD). This project features a better UI using Java Swing, as well as more mathematical features than the previous calculator. Unfortunately this project will likely remain unfinished.
